# Abnormal & Emergencies (Expert Jet Ops)

## Engine Failure After V1
- Maintain runway centerline with rudder; pitch to flight director GA/EO profile (typically 12–15°).
- Identify/confirm: gear up; verify correct engine via basic indications + ECAM/EICAS; no switch/light by feel.
- Fly first: select heading/track, engage appropriate lateral mode, then manage memory items.
- Acceleration altitude: set MCT, accelerate to VENR, flaps up on schedule; use autopilot early if available/stable.

## Rejected Takeoff (Below V1)
- Captain calls “STOP”; max braking, max reverse both engines, speed brakes/spoilers armed.
- Clear the runway; set parking brake. QRH: brake temps/fuses, evacuation as required. Notify ATC; consider brake fans.
- If decel inadequate or fire, consider evacuation; otherwise, taxi clear and reassess performance/maintenance.

## Rapid Depressurization
- Masks ON, establish crew comm. PF: AP/ATHR off if needed, idle thrust, speed brakes as required; descend to MEA/MORA.
- Target: MMO/VMO and emergency descent profile. Set alt selector to 10,000’ or MEA, turn 45° off airway if needed.
- PM: squawk 7700, ATC emergency call, seat belt signs, start APU if required for packs/elec redundancy.

## Windshear (Reactive/Reported)
- TO/GA: Set TOGA, pitch 15–18°, follow flight director WS guidance if available.
- Climb without configuration changes until clear; do not chase airspeed; avoid descending turns.
- Approach: if warning or >15 kt loss in critical phase, execute go-around; re-brief threats and consider delaying.

## Smoke/Fire/Fumes
- Masks/goggles ON; establish who is masked. Run smoke/fume removal/recirc off per QRH.
- Identify source: avionics bay, cabin, galley, lav, electrical; do not reset tripped breakers unless directed.
- Land at nearest suitable; brief single-engine or flap penalties if applicable; coordinate with cabin and ATC.
