# Dispatch & Performance (Expert Jet Ops)

## Takeoff Performance Basics
- Use balanced field length; include runway condition code, slope, elevation, packs on/off, anti-ice.
- Derates/flex: apply when runway margin exists; remove flex if contamination, tailwind, or marginal V1 cuts.
- Verify obstacle/missed approach climb limits; if close, brief EO SID or special engine-out procedure.

## Landing Performance
- Compute landing distance for actual conditions (wind, QNH, temp, runway condition code).
- Target 15–30% margin to LDA; if less, consider alternate runway/flaps/auto-brake or divert.
- Wet/contaminated: use full reverse early, higher autobrake; brief exit and roll-out threats.

## Weight & Balance
- Cross-check ZFW/TOW/LW against limits and performance sheet; ensure MAC %/stab trim set for the load.
- If last-minute changes > 500 kg (or per SOP), recompute performance and trim; coordinate with cabin for seat/zone shifts.

## Alternate & Fuel Planning
- Select alternates with solid weather (at or above derived minima) and suitable runway lengths.
- Include contingency fuel for level-offs, holds, and reroutes; brief an enroute alternate if storms/volcanic ash forecast.
- ETOPS/EDTO: verify critical fuel, redispatch points, and diversion adequacy (firefighting, runway length, nav aids).

## MEL/Configuration Considerations
- Note MEL/CDL items that affect performance (packs, anti-skid, brakes, flaps/slats, reversers).
- Adjust V-speeds and takeoff/landing data for inoperative systems; brief the abnormal profile.
