# Flight Ops Foundations (Expert Jet Ops)

## Stabilized Approach Criteria
- Gear down, flaps landing, and landing checklist complete by 1000’ AGL in IMC (500’ VMC).
- Speed within +10/-5 knots of Vapp, thrust stabilized above idle, descent < 1000 fpm unless briefed.
- On lateral/vertical path with small, prompt corrections only. If not stable, go around.

## Crosswind Control
- Use “wing low, opposite rudder” below 500’ AGL to align the nose and arrest drift.
- Target touchdown bank < 5°; if bank grows, decrab slightly and re-apply rudder.
- Add up to half steady crosswind as gust factor to Vref (limit per AFM), maintain into flare.

## Go-Around Discipline
- Trigger: unstable, windshear, conflicting traffic, runway incursion, abnormal system.
- Actions: TOGA, pitch 15–18°, verify GA mode, positive rate → gear up, flaps per profile, bug missed approach speed.
- Call the go-around early; rushing a salvage landing is the higher risk.

## Threat & Error Management
- Brief the top three threats (weather, runway condition, NOTAM/terrain) and one mitigation each.
- Define abort/continue gates for takeoff and approach; include autobrake/spoiler/arresting actions.
- Divide PF/PM tasks explicitly for high-workload phases (e.g., heads-down MCDU changes only when PM can monitor).

## Fuel Margins
- Plan landing with at least approach + final reserve; add contingency for holding + two approaches.
- In-flight, declare “minimum fuel” when projected to land at reserve; “mayday fuel” when landing below reserve is likely.
- Use a simple burn check every 30–60 minutes: FOB – planned burn = margin; if negative, act early (speed/level/alternate).
